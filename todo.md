Imported + set up p5-svelte for actual visualization work


Todo:
- [] Plan out how Spotify data will affect visualization (will take multiple steps)
- [] Get Spotify data -> p5 sketch, probably on a different page
- [] DALL-E option? Might be good for proof of concept
- [] p5 sketch implement
- [] Add name + music type back in so we can say what the user typed in (currently, the name of whatever they use is lost) 
- [] Explanation/tooltip of how viz works?
- [] CSS styling + making things look nice
