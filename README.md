# Cover Artist

Project started at Uncommon Hacks 2024 that grew beyond the scope of the hackathon. Allows users to enter a track, album or Spotify playlist and get an image based off of the song characteristics (valence, danceability, etc.). (Eventually, it's a work in progress still.)

Heavily inspired by [musicscape](https://musicscapes.herokuapp.com/). Uses the Spotipy wrapper for the Spotify API ([here](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy)). Built with Flask and Svelte (so far).
